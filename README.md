Welcome to our Peggle-like game.
The aim of this game is to destory as many 'Pegs" (The squares and circles) as you can, whilst using as little balls as possible.

The controls of the game are as follows:
Left Arrow - Aim to the left.
Right Arriw - Aim to the right.
Space bar - Fire

We have also implemented an option to choose multiple different maps:
Left Arrow - Choose map on left
Right Arriw - Choose map on right
